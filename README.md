# FrameChain

FrameChain is a library for composing chains of transformations on images. It is inspired by the utility of large vision models (LVMs) -- models that perform learned transformations on images -- and is designed to be used in conjunction with them.

If you've already used LangChain, FrameChain is very similar. The main difference is that FrameChain is designed to work with images and LVMs, while LangChain is designed to work with text and LLMs.
